U-Boot was bumped to v2026.01-rc2 for several devices, introducing BTRFS support and improved boot management. Kernel updates included the advancement of the mainline kernel to v6.18-rc6 and the upgrade of Allwinner CURRENT kernels. Desktop usability saw improvements with fixes to shortcuts, app group management, and the addition of a default user icon. New hardware support was added for boards like AM62L EVM and expanded features for devices such as the youyeetoo-r1 and sunxi64. Additional changes included power management refinements, patch cleanups, and the introduction of new CLI tools, reflecting ongoing efforts to enhance stability and user experience.\n\n## \n* Allow Helios64 to do separate /boot partition only if root placed on fs than unbootable on device.  by @iav in [armbian/build#8946](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8946)\n* cm3588-nas: u-boot: bump to v2026.01-rc2, enable BTRFS support.  by @rpardini in [armbian/build#8953](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8953)\n* Discord x86: add external sources.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8975](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8975)\n* Feat/bootscript templating.  by @djurny in [armbian/build#8935](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8935)\n* Fix desktop shortcut for Armbian config.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/configng#701](https://github.com/armbian/configng/pull/701)\n* Fixing updating Git submodule.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8962](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8962)\n* Improve Desktop AppGroups & Add Default User Icon.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8964](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8964)\n* jsoninfo: introduce `inventory-artifacts` cli.  by @rpardini in [armbian/build#8910](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8910)\n* khadas-vim3l: u-boot: bump to v2026.01-rc2, enable BTRFS and more.  by @rpardini in [armbian/build#8954](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8954)\n* lib / main-config.sh: enable APA extension for questing and resolute builds.  by @leggewie in [armbian/build#8969](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8969)\n* mainline-kernel: bump 6.18 to v6.18-rc6.  by @rpardini in [armbian/build#8956](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8956)\n* Move gxlimg to board level and some clean.  by @retro98boy in [armbian/build#8948](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8948)\n* nanopct6(-lts): u-boot: bump to v2026.01-rc2.  by @rpardini in [armbian/build#8951](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8951)\n* nanopi-r6c: u-boot: bump to v2026.01-rc2; enable BTRFS support.  by @rpardini in [armbian/build#8955](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8955)\n* odroidhc4: u-boot: bump to v2026.01-rc2.  by @rpardini in [armbian/build#8952](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8952)\n* Powere management - make it conditional, enable on UEFI targets, else disabled.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8961](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8961)\n* radxa-rock-4d: Move to standard support.  by @HeyMeco in [armbian/build#8981](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8981)\n* rock-5b: u-boot: edge: bump to v2026.01-rc2; use mainline ATF; bootorder; fancy u-boot.  by @rpardini in [armbian/build#8949](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8949)\n* Rock5B+: Udev rule for Radxa Display 8HD.  by @HeyMeco in [armbian/build#8972](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8972)\n* Rock5B-Plus and Rock5T: Use upstream u-boot.  by @HeyMeco in [armbian/build#8918](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8918)\n* rockchip-edge: cleanup and rewrite patches.  by @EvilOlaf in [armbian/build#8911](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8911)\n* rockchip: cleanup and rewrite patches for `current`.  by @EvilOlaf in [armbian/build#8912](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8912)\n* sm8250 current: Add support to load QUP SE Firmware via Linux subsystem.  by @retro98boy in [armbian/build#8942](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8942)\n* sunxi64: Enable KVM virtualization support for current kernel.  by @chbgdn in [armbian/build#8974](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8974)\n* Sync support status to match with /download.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8976](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8976)\n* ti: configs: boards: Add AM62L EVM (tmds62levm) board support.  by @jonaswood01 in [armbian/build#8960](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8960)\n* ti: k3: Fix boot, change branch names, add upstream edge.  by @jonaswood01 in [armbian/build#8926](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8926)\n* u-boot: prepare v2026.01 patch directory.  by @rpardini in [armbian/build#8950](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8950)\n* uefi: x86: current (6.12) and edge (6.18): add Apple T2 patches.  by @rpardini in [armbian/build#8879](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8879)\n* Upgrade Allwinner CURRENT kernels to latest.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8878](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8878)\n* youyeetoo-r1: enable OUT1/OUT2 switches for es8323 headphone output on vendor kernel.  by @SuperKali in [armbian/build#8963](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8963)\n# \n<a href='https://blog.armbian.com/#/portal/signup' target='_blank'>\n      <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Subscribe-blog.armbian.com-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=rss' alt='Subscribe to Blog'/></a>\n<p><br>Stay up to date with the latest Armbian news, development highlights, and tips \u2014 delivered straight to your inbox.", "mentions_count": 11}
