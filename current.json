Notable updates include new compatibility for Qualcomm serial and CDC MBIM devices, the introduction of the qcs6490 family and Radxa Dragon Q6A board, and expanded support for Realtek WiFi chips on Linux 6.17.y. Several board configurations were overhauled, including Orange Pi 5 and NanoPi M5, while u-boot and opensbi components received important version bumps. Kernel module compression and comprehensive iptables/nftables builds were enabled, and upstream releases saw improved upgrade paths. Additionally, multiple bug fixes and deprecation notices were addressed, further refining the platform\u2019s stability and usability.\n\n## \n* Add support for Qualcomm serial (qcserial) and CDC MBIM (cdc_mbim) XpressReal-T3.  by @aalaei in [armbian/build#8663](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8663)\n* AR-2758 : fix libwmf0.2-7-gtk bad name.  by @Eyolon in [armbian/build#8669](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8669)\n* armbian build machinery - allow kernel module compression..  by @tabrisnet in [armbian/build#8560](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8560)\n* armbian build machinery - force all iptables/nftables to be built.  by @tabrisnet in [armbian/build#8661](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8661)\n* Armbian-zram-config mkfs detecion gets empty string.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8672](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8672)\n* board configs sync - netfilter-modules + make oldconfig.  by @tabrisnet in [armbian/build#8678](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8678)\n* Bump 32bit rockchip boards u-boot to v2025.10-rc5.  by @paolosabatino in [armbian/build#8674](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8674)\n* Drop broken link to u-boot subfolder.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8688](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8688)\n* Improve information on HA deprecation.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/configng#667](https://github.com/armbian/configng/pull/667)\n* Introduce new family qcs6490 and new board radxa dragon q6a.  by @amazingfate in [armbian/build#8668](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8668)\n* orangepi5: overhaul board config, update mainline uboot.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8681](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8681)\n* ORAS tools parameter deprecation: since v1.3 verbosity is by default.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8680](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8680)\n* Realtek 8189ES & FS compatibility with Linux 6.17.y.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8677](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8677)\n* rockchip rk3566: h96-TVbox: Include i2c Led Pins into dts.  by @hqnicolas in [armbian/build#8666](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8666)\n* rockchip64: update tm16xx driver from kernel mailing list.  by @paolosabatino in [armbian/build#8679](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8679)\n* rockchip: Add NanoPi M5 board support to edge kernel.  by @SuperKali in [armbian/build#8684](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8684)\n* SM8550: drop patches that have been upstreamed.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8675](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8675)\n* SpacemiT: Update opensbi and u-boot to TAG v2.2.7.  by @pyavitz in [armbian/build#8657](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8657)\n* uefi-loong64-6.16: add revert patches to fix xe driver.  by @amazingfate in [armbian/build#8685](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8685)\n* Upstream releases: update release upgrade paths.  by @igorpecovnik in [armbian/build#8569](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8569)\n* [bugfix] Update binutils version checks in atf.sh.  by @chainsx in [armbian/build#8583](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/8583)\n# \n<a href='https://blog.armbian.com/#/portal/signup' target='_blank'>\n      <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Subscribe-blog.armbian.com-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=rss' alt='Subscribe to Blog'/></a>\n<p><br>Stay up to date with the latest Armbian news, development highlights, and tips \u2014 delivered straight to your inbox.", "mentions_count": 10}
